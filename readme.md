### Abstract
Simulations of epidemic spread are an active area of research with the practical aim of
advancing our understanding of real world epidemic spread and ability to mitigate it. Here,
another step is taken towards improving our understanding of the performance of various
vaccination strategies. Specifically, the focus is on investigating vaccination strategy perfor-
mance in a basic SIR model and its extension with mutating infectivity of the pathogen. The
simulation is constrained to discrete time-step SIR model of epidemic spread on small-world
networks. Beyond confirming the findings of past research, no difference between baseline
and extended model is found, suggesting a robustness of the relative vaccination strategy
performance with regards to the model extension.
